<p><strong>Vectorial Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
<p>This routine uses an optimization algorithm to find the values of a set of
parameters that maximize/minimize a chosen variable. It's able to do this by
characterizing the dynamic models as nonlinear programming problems.</p>
<p>It can be used to analyze how a set of parameters behave when perturbed
together, instead of analyzing isolated perturbations. This further increases
the chances of finding, for example, a combination of small parameter
perturbations that has a non-negligible effect on a variable, possibly showing
that the model is not as robust as previously thought.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this analysis may take several minutes, maybe hours, depending on the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The complexity of the model. Simpler models take less time to
     simulate.</li>
   <li>The number of parameters to analyze. Each parameter has to be combined with
     all the others. This means that no matter how effective the underlying
     optimization algorithm is, in the worst case scenario the analysis time
     is affected exponentially by the number of parameters to analyze.</li>
   <li>The simulation time. The shorter the internal simulation time then the
     shorter the execution time of the simulations.</li>
   <li>The epsilon. A smaller epsilon may find a better solution but at the
     expense of longer analysis time.</li>
   <li>The bounds percentage. The larger the bounds of the parameters, the more
     values the optimization algorithm has to test.</li>
   <li>The system: number of processors, disk speeds, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, take into account that if a parameter has no effect on the variable to study then its "optimum"
value returned by this feature will be misleading. For each parameter to analyze, it's recommended to
check beforehand if it has an effect on the variable. The Individual Sensitivity Analysis, also provided by OMSens, is an useful tool for this check.</p>

<p><strong>Known limitations</strong></p>
<p>Only parameters and variables of type Real are recognized. Not even renamings of the sort of 'type MyType = Real' are supported.</p>
<p>Arrays of any type are not supported either.</p>

<p><strong>Usage instructions</strong></p>
<p>
<u>Simulation tab:</u> the model (.mo) file is automatically imported from OMEdit. Specify the destination
folder for results of the simulation. For now, the only supported start time is 0. The backend optimization engine
requires a folder to store intermediate results in a .csv file
</p>
<p><u>Optimization tab:
</u> specify which parameters of the model the optimizer will explore. Note the following:<ul>
  <li>Optimizer name: CURVIF or CURVIFGR (the latter is preferred)</li>
  <li>Objective function name: with or without constraint. If set with constraint, a valid .csv filename must be specified in
  'Contraints (*.csv file)'. The .csv file must contain at least two columns: one named 'time' and another one with the name of the variable specified in Constrained Variable</li>
  <li>Alpha value (0 to 1): Weight applied on the final value of the target variable in the loss function. A (1-alpha) weight is applied on the deviation from the constrained path. To assign more importance to the constraint a high value of (1-alpha) should be set.</li>
  <li>Constrained variable: if the .csv file containing the constrained path has a column with it's name, any variable can be used in the constrained function (to be used together with the target variable value in the alpha-weighted function). In general this variable will be the same as the target variable. The name of the variable is CASE SENSITIVE. To compare the constraints with the simulated path a linear interpolation is used between the two nearest simulated points.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p><u>Parameters tab:</u>
Tick the parameters that can be perturbed by the optimization algorithm
</p>
<p><u>Plots tab:</u> When using the alpha-weighted path constrained optimization function, the followng options are provided: plot the optimal path with/without either the restriction path or the standard run path of the objective variable.
</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>This method provides an optimization (maximize of minimize) of the target variable, or a weighted function of a
variable and its deviation from a constrained path. It finds the best combination of perturbations applied to the parameters. It is mandatory to specify whether the user wants to MAXIMIZE or MINIMIZE the objective function.</p>
<p>It permits the analysis of a combined perturbation in a set of parameters, instead of trying 
isolated perturbations only. This could reveal that the model is not robust to some 
combinations of perturbations even when the model is robust against perturbations of the same parameter set but tested
individually.</p>

<p><strong>Known limitations</strong></p>
<p>Parameters and variables only of type Real are accepted. Renamings like 'type MyType = Real' are not supported either.</p>
<p>Arrays of any type are also not yet supported.</p>
<p>The plotting engine only supports a single scale for the y axis. So, if the target variable and constraining variable have different scales, the plot will might not look ok.</p>

<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>This analysis may take up several minutes, maybe hours, depending on the following:</p>
<ul>
   <li>The complexity of the model. Simpler models take less time to simulate.</li>
   <li>The number of parameters to analyze. Each parameter is combined with every other. No matter how effective the underlying optimization algorithm is, in the worst case scenario the analysis time
     is affected with the square of the number of parameters to analyze.</li>
   <li>The epsilon value. A smaller epsilon may find a better solution in the optimization but at the 
     expense of longer optimization analysis time.</li>
   <li>The parameter bounds amplitude (percentages). The larger the bounds the more
     values the optimization algorithm will try to test.</li>
   <li>The computer performance: CPU speed, OS load, available memory, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Take into account that if a parameter has no effect on the variable under study then its "optimum"
value returned by this option can lack an interpretation. For each parameter to analyze, it's recommended to
check beforehand whether it has an effect on the variable. The Individual Sensitivity Analysis provided with OMSens is useful for this verification.</p>

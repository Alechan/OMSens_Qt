<p><strong>Multiparameter sweep</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
Launches several simulations covering all combinations of parameters values as
indicated by the user.
IMPORTANT: the number of combinations of parameters that can be swept without the
deterioration of performance is of aproximately 30 combinations. If more are supplied, the
program will take too long to generate the plots if the option for plotting upper and lower
limits is turned on, and might even crash sometimes (this is because of the number of compare operations
grows exponentially whith the parameters to find the upper and lower bounds with the current algorithm.
This problem will be addressed in a following release).
Only parameters and variables of type Real are recognized. Renamings like 'type MyType = Real' are not supported either.
Arrays of any type are also not yet supported.

<p><strong>Analyze Results Tab</strong></p>
IMPORTANT: The user has to browse the desired set of experiments to analyze. The directory needs to be exactly the
directory that contains the model_info.json file and the experiment_specs.json files. If any other
directory is provided, the program will not work correctly.

This tab contains the following:
<ul>
  <li>Parameter:run_id</li>
  <li>Scatter Plot</li>
  <li>Histogram Plot</li>
  <li>Line Plots</li>
</ul>

See the documentation for more details on how to use this tool.

<p><strong>Simulation</strong></p>
Set start and end time of the simulation

<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
Select the state variables for which a sweep analysis is desired to be made. At least one of the
variables of the model should be selected.

<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
Specify for each parameter of the model, the experiment's experimental setup: the perturbation type
can be Fixed, Sweep or None.

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
Allow to (optionally) show upper and lower bound curves implied by all the parameters swept.

<!--<p>If our model has 2 parameters with the following
default values, p1=10 and p2=100; and we want to perturb them as:</p>
<ul>
   <li>p1: 2 iterations of &plusmn;5% perturbation
      <ul>
         <li>10*(1-5/100) = 9.5</li>
         <li>10*(1+5/100) = 10.5</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>p2: 3 iterations of &plusmn;10% perturbation
      <ul>
      <li>100*(1-10/100) = 95</li>
      <li>100</li>
      <li>100 *(1+10/100) = 110</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>This will result in 6 iterations (2 values for p1 and 3 for p2). The corresponding simulations will be:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Simulation 1: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 90</li>
   <li>Simulation 2: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 100</li>
   <li>Simulation 3: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 110</li>
   <li>Simulation 4: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 90</li>
   <li>Simulation 5: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 100</li>
   <li>Simulation 6: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 110</li>
   <li>Simulation 7: p1 = 10, p2 = 100 (a standard unperturbed run is always included)</li>
</ul>-->

<p><strong>Multiparameter sweep</strong></p>
<p>/home/omsens/Documents/OMSens_Qt/dialogs/sweep/help.html</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
It launches several simulations covering all combinations of parameter  values as indicated by the user.

<p><strong>Analyze Results Tab</strong></p>
IMPORTANT: The user must browse the desired set of experiments to analyze. The directory needs to be exactly the
directory that contains the model_info.json file and the experiment_specs.json files. If any other
directory is provided the program can experience unexpected behavior.

This tab contains the following:
<ul>
  <li>Parameter:run_id</li>
  <li>Scatter Plot</li>
  <li>Histogram Plot</li>
  <li>Line Plots</li>
</ul>

See the documentation for more details on how to use these options.

<p><strong>Simulation</strong></p>
Set the start and end time of the simulation

<p><strong>Variables</strong></p>
Select the state variables for which a sweep analysis is desired. At least one of the state 
variables of the model should be selected.

<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
Specify for each parameter of the model the desired perturbation type: Fixed, Sweep or None.

<p><strong>Plot</strong></p>
(Optional) Calculate and plot upper bound and lower bound curves, which emerge from the bundle of curves produced by all the combinations of perturbations tested.

<!--<p>If our model has 2 parameters with the following
default values, p1=10 and p2=100; and we want to perturb them as:</p>
<ul>
   <li>p1: 2 iterations of &plusmn;5% perturbation
      <ul>
         <li>10*(1-5/100) = 9.5</li>
         <li>10*(1+5/100) = 10.5</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
   <li>p2: 3 iterations of &plusmn;10% perturbation
      <ul>
      <li>100*(1-10/100) = 95</li>
      <li>100</li>
      <li>100 *(1+10/100) = 110</li>
      </ul>
   </li>
</ul>
<p>This will result in 6 iterations (2 values for p1 and 3 for p2). The corresponding simulations will be:</p>
<ul>
   <li>Simulation 1: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 90</li>
   <li>Simulation 2: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 100</li>
   <li>Simulation 3: p1 = 9.5, p2 = 110</li>
   <li>Simulation 4: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 90</li>
   <li>Simulation 5: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 100</li>
   <li>Simulation 6: p1 = 10.5, p2 = 110</li>
   <li>Simulation 7: p1 = 10, p2 = 100 (a standard unperturbed run is always included)</li>
</ul>-->

<p><strong>Known limitations</strong></p>
IMPORTANT: the number of combinations of parameter values that can be swept without considerable performance cost is approximately 30 combinations. If more are requested, the program might take too long to generate all plots if the option for plotting upper and lower limits is turned on (and might even crash).
This is due to the number of compare operations required that grows exponentially whith the number of parameters to find the upper and lower bounds. This issue will be addressed in a following release.
Only parameters and variables of type Real are recognized. Renamings like 'type MyType = Real' are not supported either.
Arrays of any type are also not yet supported.

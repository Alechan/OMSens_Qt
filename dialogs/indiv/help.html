<p><strong>Individual Sensitivity Analysis</strong></p>
<p>Perturbs parameters individually, one at a time and by the same percentage.</p>
<p>This type of analysis is useful to find to which parameters a variable of the model is most sensitive to.</p>
<p>The number of simulations will be equal to the number of parameters to analyze plus one, the simulation corresponding to the standard run.</p>
<p><strong>Known limitations</strong></p>
<p>Only parameters and variables of type Real are recognized. Not even renamings of the sort of 'type MyType = Real' are supported.</p>
<p>Arrays of any type are not supported either.</p>
